# AUTOVC
This repository is a part of our master's course in Speech and Speaker Recognition (DT2119) taken in Spring 2021. In this project, we aim to implement a Voice conversor that only uses an autoencoder, being inspired by this paper. Voice conversion (VC) is a technique where the speaker characteristics of a source speaker are copied onto the speech contents of a target speaker, transforming the utterance of the target speaker such that it sounds like the source speaker.
